/**
 * Import things to know about interfaces:
 * 
 * You implement an interface
 * You can implement as many interfaces as you'd like
 * You can only extend one class
 * 
 * An interface is like an abstract class because
 * it has undefined "abstract" methods
 * In fact, all of its methods are undefined
